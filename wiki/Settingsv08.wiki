#summary Settings to modify default behavior and appearance

== Setting Timeline Intervals ==

By default, the calendar displays blocks of time in 30 minute intervals. This impacts the layout because each appointments will fill the block(s) of time it overlaps.

For example: time intervals are 30 minutes, 12:00am, 12:30am, 1:00am, 1:30, etc. If an appointment is from 12:45 - 1:15 AM it will fill both the 12:30-1am and 1-1:30am blocks.

The number of minutes per time block interval can be configured in the `CalendarSettings` object by setting the `intervalsPerHour` property. By default this is set to 2 which equals 30 minute intervals (60 minuts per hour / 2 = 30 minute intervals). This could be set to 4 (15 minute intervals).
{{{
CalendarSettings settings = new CalendarSettings();
settings.setIntervalsPerHour(4);

//you can pass through constructor
DayView dayView = new DayView(settings);

//or pass via setter
dayView.setCalendarSettings(settings);
}}}

== Setting Timeline Intervals Height ==

You can also configure the height (in pixels) of a block of time. By default the 30 minute time blocks are 30px in height. This can be changed by setting the `pixelsPerInterval` property.

{{{
//set time block height to 50px
settings.setPixelsPerInterval(50);
}}}
