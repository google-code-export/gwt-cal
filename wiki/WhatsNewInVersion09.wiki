#summary Overview of what's new in the 0.9 beta

Version *0.9* of *gwt-cal* is a major release that required some big changes to it's underlying structure in order to accommodate the following features:
  # Displaying appointments in multiple views (i.e. `DayView` and `MonthView`) and seamlessly switch between them
  # Allowing a developer to create their own custom `CalendarView`
  # Displaying an appointment as multiple panels on the screen. This was required for the `MonthView`, where an appointment can span the 1st week and 2nd week of the month. This means an appointment must be displayed as two panels. Previously there was a one-to-one relationship between an appointment and a panel. Now this is a one-to-many relationship.

We also laid the ground work for *Drag and Drop* support, one of the most requested features. Right now Drag and Drop is supported in the `MonthView`, with plans to support the `DayView` in the 0.9.1 release.
