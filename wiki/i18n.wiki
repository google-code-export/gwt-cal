#summary Describes internationalization and formatting in gwt-cal

= Overview =

All date formats and labels are driven by properties file, leveraging gwt's built-in support for internationalization.

Here is an example of the properties file used for the English language:
{{{
noon=Noon
more=+{0} more
dayOfMonthFormat=d
timeFormat=h
dateFormat=EEE, MMM d
weekdayFormat=EEE
am=AM
pm=PM
firstDayOfWeek=0
}}}

And here is an example of the French language:
{{{
noon=12:00
more=+{0} en plus
dayOfMonthFormat=d
timeFormat=HH:00
dateFormat=EEE, d MMM
weekdayFormat=EEE
am=
pm=
firstDayOfWeek=0
}}}

gwt-cal currently supports the following locales:
 * English (default)
 * French (fr)
 * Spanish (es)
 * Spanish, Mexico (es_MX)
 * Norwegian (no)

If you would like to add your locale, please send us a properties file to add to our project.

= Custom Date Formatting =

Sometimes we get questions (and complex patches) asking how one can specify their own custom formats. Everything in the properties files described above can be overridden in the `CalendarFormat` class.

Let's say you want to override the EN locale to use a 24 hour format, not display AM/PM, and display 12:00 instead of noon. Here is how you would go about doing it:
{{{
CalendarFormat.INSTANCE.setTimeFormat("HH");
CalendarFormat.INSTANCE.setAm("");
CalendarFormat.INSTANCE.setPm("");
CalendarFormat.INSTANCE.setNoon("12:00");
}}}

You can, of course, go all out and customize many more properties than listed above. Check out the `CalendarFormat` class to get more familiar with what can be customized.
