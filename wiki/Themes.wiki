#summary Applying themes to the gwt-cal widget.

= Applying Themes =

The gwt-library includes a set of themes to style the calendar widget. The desired theme must be inherited in the `<your application>.gwt.xml` module file.

{{{
  <!-- inherit this module for a Google look and feel -->
  <inherits name='com.bradrydzewski.gwt.calendar.theme.google.Google' />

  <!-- inherit this module for an Outlook look and feel -->
  <inherits name='com.bradrydzewski.gwt.calendar.theme.outlook.Outlook' />

  <!-- inherit this module for an iCal look and feel -->
  <inherits name='com.bradrydzewski.gwt.calendar.theme.ical.iCal' />
}}}

=== iCal Hour Labels ===

To achieve a more authentic iCal style we also need to change how the Hour labels are displayed. Google Calendar and Outlook hour labels are centered in-between major hour intervals as demonstrated below:
<pre>
 ---------
     |    
 1am |    
     |    
 ---------
     |    
 2am |    
     |    
 ---------
</pre>

iCal hour labels, however, are aligned on the same x-axis as major hour intervals:
<pre>
 1am -----
     |
     |
     |
 2am -----
</pre>

By default, all labels are centered between major hour intervals. To change this default behavior we need to create a `CalendarSettings` object and set the hour labels offset to true.  
{{{
CalendarSettings settings = new CalendarSettings();
settings.setOffsetHourLabels(true);
}}}
The `CalendarSettings` can be provided to the `DayView` either through the constructor or a setter. The hour labels will then align to the major hour interval's x-axis.
